[See here](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-stats-reporter) for more information.\r\n\r\n**Have a question about the module or coding in general? *Do not create a GitHub issue.* GitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports. Instead, post in the [dedicated forum](https://dev.doctormckay.com/forum/7-node-steam-user/). Such issues may be ignored!**\r\n\r\n# Contents\r\n- [Enums](#enums-)\r\n- [Static Properties](#static-properties-)\r\n- [Static Methods](#static-methods-)\r\n- [Options](#options-)\r\n- [Properties](#properties-)\r\n- [Methods](#methods-)\r\n- [Events](#events-)\r\n\r\n# Enums [^](#contents)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of enums used in Steam. They're all available directly from `SteamUser`. For example, access `EResult`\r\nusing `SteamUser.EResult`.\r\n\r\nAll enums can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/tree/master/enums).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for convenience, the name of an enum value is available from any enum at the key identified by the enum\r\nvalue. For example, given an EResult of `88` you can translate it using `SteamUser.EResult[88]` which gives you\r\nthe string `TwoFactorCodeMismatch`.\r\n\r\n# Static Properties [^](#contents)\r\n\r\nStatic properties, or properties attached directly to `SteamUser`, are accessed on the root module and not on instantiated handler instances.\r\n\r\n### Steam\r\n\r\nThe `node-steam-client` module installation used by `SteamUser`. You can use this in place of `require('steam-client')`\r\nif you'd like to avoid duplicate installations. As of v3.7.0, all enums are built into `SteamUser` so you probably won't\r\nneed to use this. Example of using `EResult`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar ok = SteamUser.EResult.OK;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Static Methods [^](#contents)\r\n\r\nStatic methods, or functions attached directly to `SteamUser`, are called on the root module and not on instantiated handler instances.\r\n\r\n### formatCurrency(amount, currency)\r\n- `amount` - The amount of the currency\r\n- `currency` - The currency code value in the [`ECurrencyCode`](#ecurrencycode) enum\r\n\r\nFormats a currency value and returns a string. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12.34, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.USD)); // $12.34\r\nconsole.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12345, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.JPY)); // � 12345\r\nconsole.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(123.45, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.EUR)); // 123,45�\r\n```\r\n\r\n### generateAuthCode(secret[, timeOffset])\r\n- `secret` - A `Buffer`, hex string, or base64 string containing your shared secret\r\n- `timeOffset` - The number of seconds by which your local clock is off from the Steam servers. Defaults to 0.\r\n\r\nGenerates a 5-digit alphanumeric Steam Guard code for use with two-factor mobile authentication.\r\n\r\n**Deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use [`steam-totp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) instead.**\r\n\r\n# Options [^](#contents)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of options which can control the behavior of the `SteamUser` object. They are:\r\n\r\n### dataDirectory\r\n\r\nControls where the Steam server list and sentry files are written. If `null`, no data will be automatically stored.\r\n\r\nDefaults to a platform-specific user data directory.\r\n\r\n- On [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), this is `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/node-steamuser`\r\n- On Windows, this is `%localappdata%\\doctormckay\\node-steamuser`\r\n- On Mac, this is `~/Library/Application Support/node-steamuser`\r\n- On Linux, this is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/node-steamuser`, or `~/.local/share/node-steamuser` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` isn't defined or is empty\r\n\r\n#### Custom Storage Engine\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to (or can't) save data to the disk, you can implement your own storage engine. To do this, simply add the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuser.storage.on('save', function(filename, contents, callback) {\r\n\t// filename is the name of the file, as a string\r\n\t// contents is a Buffer containing the file's contents\r\n\t// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with a single error argument\r\n\r\n\t// For example:\r\n\tsomeStorageSystem.saveFile(filename, contents, function(err) {\r\n\t\tcallback(err);\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\nuser.storage.on('read', function(filename, callback) {\r\n\t// filename is the name of the file, as a string\r\n\t// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with an error argument and a Buffer argument\r\n\r\n\t// For example:\r\n\tsomeStorageSystem.readFile(filename, function(err, file) {\r\n\t\tif(err) {\r\n\t\t\tcallback(err);\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tcallback(null, file);\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this manner, you can save data to a database, a cloud service, or anything else you choose.\r\n\r\n### autoRelogin\r\n\r\nA boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will automatically reconnect to Steam if disconnected due to Steam going down.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### singleSentryfile\r\n\r\nA boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will use a single sentry file for all accounts.\r\n\r\nIf off, a file named `sentry.accountname.bin` will be saved for each account.\r\nIf on, a file named `sentry.bin` will be used for all accounts.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n### promptSteamGuardCode\r\n\r\nA boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will automatically prompt for Steam Guard codes when necessary from `stdin`.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n### machineIdType\r\n\r\nWhat kind of machine ID will SteamUser send to Steam when logging on? Should be a value from [`EMachineIDType`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/resources/EMachineIDType.js).\r\n\r\nAdded in 1.7.0.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `AccountNameGenerated`.\r\n\r\n### machineIdFormat\r\n\r\nIf you're using `machineIdType` `AccountGenerated`, this is the format it uses. This is an array of three strings, each of which will be hashed with SHA1 before being sent to Steam. `{account_name}` will be replaced with the current account name.\r\n\r\nAdded in 1.13.0.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `[\"SteamUser Hash BB3 {account_name}\", \"SteamUser Hash FF2 {account_name}\", \"SteamUser Hash 3B3 {account_name}\"]`.\r\n\r\n### enablePicsCache\r\n\r\nIf enabled, then `node-steam-user` will internally cache data about all apps and packages that it knows about.\r\nCurrently, `node-steam-user` \"knows about\" an app/package if:\r\n\r\n- Packages\r\n    - You own it\r\n    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`\r\n- Apps\r\n    - It's in a known package\r\n    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`\r\n    - A friend who is online plays the app\r\n    - You request info about an online user who is playing it via `getPersonas`\r\n\r\nThis option is required in order to use several methods and events. This works when logging in anonymously.\r\n\r\nAdded in 3.3.0.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n### picsCacheAll\r\n\r\nIf enabled, `enablePicsCache` is enabled, and `changelistUpdateInterval` is nonzero, then apps and packages which get\r\nupdated while your bot is running will also be added to the cache. Default behavior is to only cache apps and packages\r\nthat are \"known\" via the above criteria.\r\n\r\nAdded in 3.3.0.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `false`.\r\n\r\n### changelistUpdateInterval\r\n\r\nIf `enablePicsCache` is enabled, then `node-steam-user` will automatically request app/package changes (via\r\n`getProductChanges`) for known apps and packages, and update the internal cache when they update. Set to `0` to disable.\r\n\r\nAdded in 3.3.0.\r\n\r\nDefaults to `60000`.\r\n\r\n# Properties [^](#contents)\r\n\r\n### client\r\n\r\nThe `SteamClient` which is being used to communicate with Steam.\r\n\r\n### steamID\r\n\r\n`null` if not connected, a [`SteamID`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamid) containing your SteamID otherwise.\r\n\r\n### options\r\n\r\nAn object containing options for this `SteamUser`. **Read-only**, use `setOption` or `setOptions` to change an option.\r\n\r\n### publicIP\r\n\r\n**v1.12.0 or later is required to use this property**\r\n\r\nOnly defined if you're currently logged on.

When you log on, `SteamUser` will use this sentry file.\r\n\r\nYou can provide either an entire sentryfile (preferred), or a Buffer containing the binary SHA1 hash of your sentryfile\r\n(e.g. the output of the `sentry` event in node-steam 0.6.x).\r\n\r\n### logOn([details])\r\n- `details` - An object containing details for this logon\r\n\t- `accountName` - If logging into a user account, the account's name\r\n\t- `password` - If logging into an account without a login key, the account's password\r\n\t- `authCode` - If you have a Steam Guard email code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)\r\n\t- `twoFactorCode` - If you have a Steam Guard mobile two-factor authentication code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)\r\n\t- `loginKey` - If logging into an account with a login key, this is the account's login key\r\n\t- `rememberPassword` - `true` if you want to get a login key which can be used in lieu of a password for subsequent logins. `false` or omitted otherwise.\r\n\t- `logonID` - A number to identify this login. The official Steam client derives this from your machine's private IP (it's the `obfustucated_private_ip` field in `CMsgClientLogOn`). If you try to logon twice to the same account from the same public IP with the same `logonID`, the first session will be kicked with reason `SteamUser.EResult.LogonSessionReplaced`. Defaults to `0` if not specified.\r\n\t- `machineName` - A string containing the name of this machine that you want to report to Steam. This will be displayed on steamcommunity.com when you view your games list (when logged in).\r\n\t- `dontRememberMachine` - If you're providing an `authCode` but you don't want Steam to remember this sentryfile, pass `true` here.\r\n\r\n**v3.11.0 or later is required to use `machineName` or `dontRememberMachine`.**\r\n\r\nLogs onto Steam. The `CMClient`/`SteamClient` should **not** be already logged on, although as of v3.4.0 it can be\r\nconnected. Omit the `details` object if you wish to login to an anonymous user account.\r\n\r\n### logOff()\r\n\r\nLogs you off of Steam and closes the connection.\r\n\r\n### relog()\r\n\r\n**v3.18.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nLogs you off of Steam and then immediately back on. If you aren't logged into an anonymous account, then you **must**\r\nset `rememberPassword` to `true` when logging on initially to use this. You also **must** wait for the\r\n[`loginKey`](#loginkey) event to be emitted before you can use this. Attempts to call this method without both\r\ncriteria being met will result in an `Error` being thrown and nothing else will happen.\r\n\r\nWhen used, `disconnected` and then `loggedOn` will be emitted in succession. This is essentially the same as using\r\n`logOff()` and then calling `logOn()` immediately in the `disconnected` event callback.\r\n\r\n### webLogOn()\r\n\r\n`SteamUser` will automatically log onto steamcommunity.com when a successful connection to Steam is established (as an\r\nindividual user), but you can call `webLogOn()` to create a new session if your old one expires or becomes invalid.\r\n\r\nListen for the [`webSession`](#websession) event to get your cookies.\r\n\r\n### createAccount(accountName, password, email, callback)\r\n- `accountName` - The username of your new account\r\n- `password` - The password for your new account\r\n- `email` - The contact email for your new account\r\n- `callback` - Called when the account is either created or an error occurs\r\n\t- `result` - A value from `SteamUser.EResult`.\r\n\t\t- `SteamUser.EResult.OK` if the account was created successfully\r\n\t\t- `SteamUser.EResult.DuplicateName` if there is already an account with that username\r\n\t\t- `SteamUser.EResult.IllegalPassword` if your password is too weak or otherwise bad\r\n\t\t- or something else on another error\r\n\t- `steamid` - If successful, this is a `SteamID` object containing the new account's SteamID\r\n\r\nCreates a new individual user Steam account. You must be logged on either anonymously or as an existing individual user\r\nto use this.\r\n\r\n**Currently it seems that Steam is not properly sending back the SteamID of the newly-created account. The `steamid`\r\nargument in the callback is currently `null`.**\r\n\r\n### requestValidationEmail([callback])\r\n- `callback` - Optional. Called when a response is available\r\n\t- `result` - A value from `SteamUser.EResult`. `SteamUser.EResult.OK` if the mail was sent successfully.\r\n\r\nRequests Steam to send you a validation email to your registered email address.\r\n\r\n### enableTwoFactor(callback)\r\n- `callback` - Required. Called when the activation email has been sent.\r\n\t- `response` - An object containing the response data\r\n\r\n**v2.0.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nStarts the process to turn on TOTP for your account. You must have a phone number already linked with and verified on your account.\r\n\r\nYou'll be sent an SMS with an activation code that you'll need to provide to `finalizeTwoFactor`.\r\n\r\n**You should save the entire `response` object somewhere secure.** You can use `JSON.stringify` on it safely.\r\n\r\nProperties of note in the `response` object:\r\n- `status` - A value from `EResult`. If this is not `OK` (1), then the request failed.\r\n- `shared_secret` - This is your secret that's used for two-factor authentication.\r\n- `revocation_code` - You will need this in the future to disable two-factor authentication.\r\n\r\n### finalizeTwoFactor(secret, activationCode, callback)\r\n- `secret` - A `Buffer` containing your shared secret\r\n- `activationCode` - A `string` containing the activation code you got in your SMS\r\n- `callback` - Required.\r\n\t- `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success\r\n\r\n**v2.0.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nFinishes the process of enabling TOTP two-factor authentication for your account. You can use [`steam-totp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) in the future when logging on to get a code.\r\n\r\n**If TOTP two-factor authentication is enabled, a code will be required *on every login* unless a `loginKey` is used.**\r\n\r\n### disableTwoFactor(options, callback)\r\n\r\n#### This method no longer works. Attempts to call it will result in an Error being thrown.

Called when the request completes.\r\n    - `err` - `null` on success, or an `Error` object on failure\r\n\r\n**v3.13.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nRequests Steam to send you an email that contains a code you can supply to `changePassword` in order to change your\r\naccount's password. If you have a Mobile Authenticator enabled, this will return success but not actually do anything.\r\nWith 2FA, you should use a 2FA code instead of an email code.\r\n\r\n### changePassword(oldPassword, newPassword, code[, callback])\r\n- `oldPassword` - Your account's current (old) password\r\n- `newPassword` - Your desired new password\r\n- `code` - Either the code sent to your email from `requestPasswordChangeEmail` or your current Mobile Authenticator 2FA code (if you have 2FA on)\r\n- `callback` - Optional.

First, call this with only\r\nyour `password` and `newEmail`. This will cause Steam to send an email to your new email address containing a\r\nverification code. Once you have that code, call this again with your `password`, `newEmail`, and `code`.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Mobile Authenticator (2FA) enabled on your account, then for the second request you will need to include\r\nyour current 2FA code as `twoFactorCode`. If you don't and `needsSmsCode` was `true` in the callback to the first request,\r\nthen Steam has sent a verification code in an SMS to your phone. In this case, you need to provide that code as `smsCode`\r\nin the second request.\r\n\r\n`needsSmsCode` may still be `true` in the callback to the second request. In this case, simply ignore it. If you received\r\nno `err`, then your email was changed. The [`emailInfo`](#emailinfo-1) event will be emitted when your email changes.\r\n\r\n**Changing your account's email will start a 5-day trading cooldown.**\r\n\r\n### kickPlayingSession([callback])\r\n- `callback` - Optional.

Emitted when the request completes.\r\n    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure or `null` on success.\r\n\r\n**v3.15.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nSets a nickname on a user. If one already exists, overwrites it. The `myNicknames` property will be updated just before\r\nthe callback fires, on success.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Using this doesn't appear to send a notification to any other instances that may be logged on. It appears to\r\nalso be possible for Steam to report success when using this method, when in reality your nickname wasn't saved on the\r\nserver. You won't be able to detect this without requesting the user's Steam profile via HTTP(S) or reconnecting to the\r\nCM, as the `myNicknames` property is updated automatically when this method reports success without verifying with the\r\nserver.\r\n\r\n### getGameBadgeLevel(appid, callback)\r\n- `appid` - The AppID of the game you want to get your badge level for\r\n- `callback` - Called when the requested data is available.\r\n    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success\r\n    - `steamLevel` - Your own Steam level\r\n    - `badgeLevel` - The level on your badge for this game (0 if you don't have one)\r\n    - `foilBadgeLevel` - The level on your foil badge for this game (0 if you don't have one)\r\n\r\n**v3.8.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nGets your own Steam Level, and the level you have on a badge for a particular game.\r\n\r\n### inviteToGroup(userSteamID, groupSteamID)\r\n- `userSteamID` - The SteamID of the user you want to invite, as a `SteamID` object or a string which can parse into one\r\n- `groupSteamID` - The SteamID of the group you want to invite the user to, as a `SteamID` object or a string which can parse into one\r\n\r\n**v3.7.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nInvites a user to a Steam group.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Only send group invites in response to a user's request; sending automated group invites is a violation of\r\nthe Steam Subscriber Agreement and can get you banned.\r\n\r\n### respondToGroupInvite(groupSteamID, accept)\r\n- `groupSteamID` - The SteamID of the group you were invited to, as a `SteamID` object or a string which can parse into one\r\n- `accept` - `true` to join the group, `false` to ignore the invitation\r\n\r\n**v3.7.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nJoins a group you were invited to or ignores the invite.\r\n\r\n### trade(steamID)\r\n- `steamID` - Either a `SteamID` object or a string which can parse into one\r\n\r\n**v1.9.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nSend a trade request to the specified user.

This package is\r\nautomatically granted to all accounts (but not anonymous ones). Games in this package do not need a license to be\r\nexplicitly requested.\r\n\r\nAll newer free-to-play games have \"free-on-demand packages\". These are packages that are not automatically granted to\r\nall accounts, but will be granted upon request (\"on demand\"). This is so that the Steam client can show free-to-play\r\ngames you have previously added to your library when not installed. In order to \"play\" any free-to-play app that isn't\r\nin sub 0, you need to request a license for it using this method.\r\n\r\nIf successful, calling this method will result in the [`licenses`](#licenses-1) event being emitted containing your new\r\nlicense(s).\r\n\r\n### getEncryptedAppTicket(appid[, userData], callback)\r\n- `appid` - The Steam AppID of the app for which you want a ticket\r\n- `userData` - If the app expects some \"user data\" (arbitrary data which will be encrypted into the ticket), provide it here. Otherwise, omit this argument or pass an empty Buffer.\r\n- `callback` - Called when the request completes\r\n    - `err` - If there was an error, this is an `Error` object. Otherwise, it's `null`.\r\n    - `ticket` - If successful, this is your encrypted appticket as a Buffer. You should provide the entire contents of the Buffer to the recipient.\r\n\r\n**v3.14.0 or later is required to use this method**\r\n\r\nRequests an \"encrypted app ticket\" from Steam servers for a particular game. This can be used to prove your ownership of\r\nan app and also your account identity to some publisher server, provided they're expecting an encrypted app ticket.\r\nTo use encrypted app tickets, publishers must set up an encryption key in the Steamworks backend. Therefore, this will\r\nnot work if encrypted tickets haven't been set up for the AppID you request a ticket for. You cannot decrypt an\r\nencrypted app ticket, nor can you view anything it contains. It is for all intents and purposes an opaque blob of binary\r\ndata which only the developer/publisher of the game can do anything with.\r\n\r\n# Events [^](#contents)\r\n\r\n## ID Events\r\n\r\nEvents marked as **ID events** are special. They all have a `SteamID` object as their first parameter. In addition to the event itself firing, a second event comprised of `eventName + \"#\" + steamID.getSteamID64()` is fired.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// This will fire when we receive a chat message from ANY friend\r\nuser.on('friendMessage', function(steamID, message) {\r\n\tconsole.log(\"Friend message from \" + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + \": \" + message);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// This will fire when we receive a chat message from [U:1:46143802] / 76561198006409530 ONLY\r\nuser.on('friendMessage#76561198006409530', function(steamID, message) {\r\n\tconsole.log(\"Friend message from \" + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + \": \" + message);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### loggedOn\r\n- `details` - An object containing various details about your account (see [`CMsgClientLogonResponse`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto#L93-L116))\r\n- `parental` - An object containing your parental controls settings\r\n\r\n**v3.5.0 or later is required to use `parental`.**\r\n\r\nEmitted when you're successfully logged into Steam.\r\n\r\n### steamGuard\r\n- `domain` - If an email code is needed, the domain name of the address where the email was sent. `null` if an app code is needed.\r\n- `callback` - Should be called when the code is available.\r\n\t- `code` - The Steam Guard auth code\r\n- `lastCodeWrong` - `true` if you're using 2FA and the last code you provided was wrong, `false` otherwise\r\n\r\nIf the `promptSteamGuardCode` option is disabled, this event will be emitted when Steam requests a Steam Guard code from us. You should collect the code from the user somehow and then call the `callback` with the code as the sole argument.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuser.on('steamGuard', function(domain, callback) {\r\n\tconsole.log(\"Steam Guard code needed from email ending in \" + domain);\r\n\tvar code = getCodeSomehow();\r\n\tcallback(code);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### error\r\n- `err` - An `Error` object\r\n\r\nEmitted when an error occurs during logon. Also emitted if we're disconnected and `autoRelogin` is either disabled, or it's a fatal disconnect.\r\n\r\nIf this event isn't handled, the program will crash.\r\n\r\nThe `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted. The `Error` object will have an `eresult` parameter which is a value from the [`EResult`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/SteamLanguage/eresult.steamd) enum.\r\n\r\n### disconnected\r\n- `eresult` - A value from the `SteamUser.EResult` enum\r\n- `msg` - A string describing the reason for the disconnect, if available (might be undefined)\r\n\r\nEmitted when we're disconnected from Steam for a non-fatal reason and `autoRelogin` is enabled. `SteamUser` will\r\ncontinually retry connection and will either emit `loggedOn` when logged back on, or `error` if a fatal logon error is\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nAlso emitted in response to a logOff() call.\r\n\r\nThe `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted.\r\n\r\nThe `eresult` value might be 0 (Invalid), which indicates that the disconnection was due to the connection being closed\r\ndirectly, without Steam sending a LoggedOff message.\r\n\r\n### sentry\r\n- `sentry` - A Buffer containing your new sentry file\r\n\r\nEmitted when Steam sends us a new sentry file. By default, `SteamUser` will automatically save and reuse this sentry file for subsequent logins, but if you wish you may handle it yourself (see [`setSentry`](#setsentrysentry)).\r\n\r\n### webSession\r\n- `sessionID` - The value of the `sessionid` cookie\r\n- `cookies` - An array of cookies, as `name=value` strings\r\n\r\nEmitted when a steamcommunity.com web session is successfully negotiated. This will automatically be emitted on logon and in response to [`webLogOn`](#weblogon) calls.\r\n\r\nSome libraries require you to provide your `sessionID`, others don't. If your library doesn't, you can safely ignore it.\r\n\r\n### loginKey\r\n- `key` - Your login key\r\n\r\nIf you enabled `rememberPassword` in [`logOn`](#logondetails), this will be emitted when Steam sends us a new login key. This key can be passed to [`logOn`](#logondetails) as `loginKey` in lieu of a password on subsequent logins.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I'm not sure if login keys expire, so to be safe you should record this somewhere (in a database, in a file, etc) and overwrite it every time the event is emitted.\r\n\r\n### newItems\r\n- `count` - How many new items you have (can be 0)\r\n\r\nEmitted when Steam sends a notification of new items. You can reset the count to 0 by loading your inventory page (https://steamcommunity.com/my/inventory) while logged in.\r\n\r\n### newComments\r\n- `count` - How many total new comments you have (can be 0)\r\n- `myItems` - How many of the total comments are on your content (workshop items, screenshots, your profile, etc.)\r\n- `discussions` - How many of the total comments are posts in subscribed discussion threads\r\n\r\nEmitted when Steam sends a notification of new comments.\r\n\r\n### tradeOffers\r\n- `count` - How many active received trade offers you have (can be 0)\r\n\r\nEmitted when Steam sends a notification of new trade offers.\r\n\r\n### offlineMessages\r\n- `count` - How many unread offline chat messages you have\r\n- `friends` - An array of SteamID strings for the users who have sent you unread offline chat messages\r\n\r\nEmitted when Steam sends a notification of unread offline chat messages. This will always be emitted after logon, even if you have no messages.\r\n\r\n### vanityURL\r\n- `url` - Your new vanity URL\r\n\r\n**v3.7.0 or later is required to use this event**\r\n\r\nEmitted when your vanity URL changes. `url` is your new vanity URL. This event is emitted before the [`vanityURL`](#vanityurl)\r\nproperty is updated, so you can compare to see what changed.\r\n\r\n### accountInfo\r\n- `name` - Your account's Steam (persona) name\r\n- `country` - The character code from which you're logging in (via GeoIP), e.g. \"US\"\r\n- `authedMachines` - How many machines are authorized to login to your account with Steam Guard\r\n- `flags` - Your account's bitwise [flags](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/b80cdf5249891d54c655e39262d8267c7b40b249/Resources/SteamLanguage/enums.steamd#L81-L113)\r\n- `facebookID` - If your account is linked with Facebook, this is your Facebook account ID\r\n- `facebookName` - If your account is linked with Facebook, this is your (real) name on Facebook\r\n\r\n**v3.4.0 or later is required to use this event**\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when account info changes. This event is emitted before the [`accountInfo`](#accountinfo) property is updated, so you can compare to see what changed.\r\n\r\n### emailInfo\r\n- `address` - Your account's email address\r\n- `validated` - A boolean value for whether or not your email address is validated\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when email info changes. The [`emailInfo`](#emailinfo) property will be updated after this event is emitted.\r\n\r\n### accountLimitations\r\n- `limited` - `true` if your account is [limited](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663), `false` if not\r\n- `communityBanned` - `true` if your account is banned from Steam Community, `false` if not\r\n- `locked` - `true` if your account is [locked](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6416-FHVM-3982), `false` if not (accounts can also be locked by Support)\r\n- `canInviteFriends` - `true` if your account can invite friends, `false` if not\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when limitations change. The [`limitations`](#limitations) property will be updated after this event is emitted.\r\n\r\n### vacBans\r\n- `numBans` - How many bans your account has\r\n- `appids` - The AppIDs from which you're banned. Since each ban affects a range of AppIDs, some of the AppIDs in this array may not exist.\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and probably when you get banned/unbanned. The [`vac`](#vac) property will be updated after this event is emitted.\r\n\r\n### wallet\r\n- `hasWallet` - `true` if your account has a Steam Wallet, `false` if not\r\n- `currency` - The currency ID of your account's wallet (the enum of currencies is available as `SteamUser.ECurrencyCode`)\r\n- `balance` - Your account's current wallet balance\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when wallet balance changes. The [`wallet`](#wallet) property will be updated after this event is emitted.\r\n\r\n### licenses\r\n- `licenses` - An array of licenses\r\n\r\nContains the license data for the packages which your Steam account owns. To see license object structure, see\r\n[`CMsgClientLicenseList.License`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto#L307-L320).\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when licenses change. The [`licenses`](#licenses) property will be updated after this event is\r\nemitted.\r\n\r\nThis isn't emitted for anonymous accounts. However, all anonymous user accounts have a license for package 17906\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n### gifts\r\n- `gifts` - An array of gift objects\r\n\r\nEmitted on logon and when you receive/accept/decline a gift or guest pass. The [`gifts`](#gifts) property will be\r\nupdated after this event is emitted.\r\n\r\nGuest Passes (do they even still exist?) are gifts (actually, gifts are Guest Passes with a very long expiration date).\r\nConsequently, both come through this event.\r\n\r\nEach object in the array is an oustanding gift or guest pass that was sent to you that you haven't accepted/declined yet.\r\nOnly **outstanding** gifts show up here. Gifts that you stored in your inventory don't show up here.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the objects in the array is defined in the documentation for the [`gifts`](#gifts) property.\r\n\r\n### appOwnershipCached\r\n\r\n**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this event**\r\n\r\nEmitted once we have all data required in order to determine app ownership.
